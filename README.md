# Cellular_Growth_CA
Python-based code to perform Cellular Automata simulation and modeling of growing cells in 2D.

## Modeling Cell Growth

## Including replication and segregation

## Developed codes

### Base Codes

_celular_growth_ca.py_ : is the "main" code to perform the simulations

_cgca_functions.py_ : it includes all the functions used to perform the simulations.

### Suplementary Codes

_ratios_simulations.py_ : Run a number of simulations with different values of one parameter (growth rate ratios in this case).

_make_plots.py_ : Makes plots of the data ceollected from the simulations.
